Welcome to the **Array Base Banded** repository! This project provides a set of utilities for working with banded arrays in JavaScript. Banded arrays are a compact way to store matrices, especially when most of the elements are zero or when only a few diagonals are of interest. Our utilities simplify the manipulation and storage of these structures, making it easier for developers to work with matrices efficiently.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To get started, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/georgelp97/array-base-banded/releases). Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the release notes to execute the necessary files.

## 📦 Installation

You can install the package via npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install array-base-banded
```

After installation, you can import the utilities into your project:

```javascript
const bandedArray = require('array-base-banded');
```

## 🛠️ Features

- **Compact Storage**: Efficiently store banded matrices, saving memory.
- **Utilities**: A range of functions to manipulate and interact with banded arrays.
- **Node.js Support**: Fully compatible with Node.js environments.

## 📖 Documentation

### Banded Array Creation

You can create a banded array using the following function:

```javascript
const array = bandedArray.createBandedArray(rows, cols, bands);
```

- `rows`: Number of rows in the matrix.
- `cols`: Number of columns in the matrix.
- `bands`: An array defining the bands to be included.

### Accessing Elements

To access an element in the banded array, use:

```javascript
const value = bandedArray.getElement(array, rowIndex, colIndex);
```

### Setting Elements

To set an element in the banded array, use:

```javascript
bandedArray.setElement(array, rowIndex, colIndex, value);
```

### Example Usage

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to create and manipulate a banded array:

```javascript
const bandedArray = require('array-base-banded');

// Create a 5x5 banded array with 3 bands
const myArray = bandedArray.createBandedArray(5, 5, [0, 1, -1]);

// Set an element
bandedArray.setElement(myArray, 2, 3, 10);

// Get an element
const value = bandedArray.getElement(myArray, 2, 3);
console.log(value); // Output: 10
```

This image illustrates how banded arrays store data efficiently. Notice how only the non-zero elements are stored, reducing memory usage.

## 📊 Examples

### Use Case: Sparse Matrices

Banded arrays are particularly useful in scenarios involving sparse matrices. In many scientific computations, matrices are mostly filled with zeros. Banded arrays allow you to focus only on the significant elements, leading to better performance and reduced memory footprint.

### Use Case: Linear Algebra

In linear algebra, banded matrices often arise in systems of equations. Our utilities help solve these systems more efficiently by leveraging the structure of the banded arrays.
